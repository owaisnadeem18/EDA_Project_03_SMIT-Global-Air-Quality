# EDA_Project_03_SMIT-Global-Air-Quality
This project explores global air quality data to analyze pollution trends, seasonal variations, city-wise AQI, and average pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO). It highlights cities exceeding safe limits and uses charts, heatmaps, maps, and boxplots for clear insights.
