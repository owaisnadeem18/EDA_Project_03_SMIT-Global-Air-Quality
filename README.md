# 📌 Project #3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Global Air Quality Data

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project explores **global air quality data** to analyze **pollution trends, seasonal variations, city-wise AQI**, and **average pollutant levels** such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO. The goal is to identify patterns, highlight cities exceeding safe limits, and understand seasonal and regional variations in air quality.

Through this analysis, we aim to support informed decision-making for environmental management and public health policies.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Global Air Quality Data in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)  
- **Content:** The dataset contains air quality measurements from multiple cities, including:
  - Air Quality Index (AQI)
  - Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO
  - Dates and seasonal information
  - Geographical location (city, state)

## 📝 Project Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning**: handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- Explore **city-wise AQI** and identify areas exceeding safe limits
- Analyze **seasonal and temporal variations** in pollution levels
- Visualize **trends and distributions** using charts, heatmaps, maps, and boxplots
- Derive actionable insights for air quality management

## 🎯 Assignment Questions (Global Air Quality EDA)

### Problem Statement:
Air pollution is one of the most pressing global environmental challenges, directly impacting human health, ecosystems, and climate. Monitoring air quality helps policymakers and environmental agencies make informed decisions to control emissions and protect public health. In this project, we will explore global air quality datasets to identify pollution trends, seasonal variations, and city/country comparisons.

### EDA Questions:
1. Which cities have the highest average AQI (Air Quality Index)?  
2. How does AQI vary by month or season?  
3. What pollutants are recorded, and what are their average levels?  
4. Which city has the cleanest air on average?  
5. Are there any missing data patterns in the dataset?  
6. Which cities consistently exceed safe pollution limits?  
7. How do pollution levels vary between weekdays and weekends?  

### Visualization Questions:
1. Bar chart of Top 10 most polluted cities by AQI.  
2. Line plot showing monthly AQI trends for selected cities.  
3. Heatmap showing correlation between pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO).  
4. Seasonal comparison plot of average AQI levels.  
5. Stacked bar chart of pollutant contributions in different cities.  
6. Map visualization showing geographic distribution of AQI values.  
7. Boxplot comparing AQI across major cities.  

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## 📌 Key Insights
- Cities with the highest and lowest AQI  
- Seasonal variations of pollutants  
- Correlations between different pollutants  
- Trends and regional pollution hotspots  
- Visualizations for easy understanding of pollution patterns
